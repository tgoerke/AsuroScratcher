Using Mesh - Not very promissing 
--------------------------------

Mesh can be used to connect several Scratch instances together in order
to share Sensor Values. Broadcasts in one Scratch instance will then be
available as Sensor Values in the other instance. Sprites can be shared.
I found a little scratch project acting as a mirror that redirects all
such broadcasts to port 42001 at localhost. These server instance can
receive the broadcast packages and act on then. So you need to load the
scratch mirror project and adapt it.

On activating Mesh
------------------

In standard Scatch the Mesh functionality has to be activated using a
hidden (easteregg) trick. Not so in the varions Scratch modifications
that exist. I liked most the BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks). This brings
(among many other fratures) the ability to make exe files from scratch
projects which might become handy for "deploying" (You don't want to
fiddle with a complicated setup once you use it in a school ...)
